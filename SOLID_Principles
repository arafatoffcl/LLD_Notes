SOLID Principles:
----------------
-> The SOLID principle helps in reducing tight coupling. Tight coupling means a group of classes are highly dependent on one another which you should avoid in 
your code.

-> Loosely coupled classes minimize changes in your code, helps in making code more reusable, maintainable, flexible, easily testable and stable.
